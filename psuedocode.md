Added all Heroku Needed File structure
downloaded Express, concurrency, and if-env
Server.js, routes.js(index.js, api= generic.js, index.js, controller=genericController.js)

Ran in client folder. Made sure it was running. Pushed to Github. 

Deployed to Heroku. It should work. 

//Working with Client

Made two components, SearchBar and Header. Was able to make them functioning and added some css and MaterialUiCore to look nice. 

Created two pages that I assume I might need. Unsure still

//API with Google Books 

//Grabbed the API Key from Google developer. and was able to have a json file appear with information on any book I clicked with also a lot of info as to what I can do with that data. 

//Fixed what was wrong with button, look at how onChange and onSubmit are now.

Created the Controller a Post and mongoDb syntax. Then pushed all into a Model that has a schema. 

Check out Map function at bottom of SearchBar.js. Great example of how to loop through an array provided through the API and using the function you made. 

Ripped of the Utils API.js from a Class Activity because it had all our needed routes. Manipulated the SaveBook and GetBook one.

Now we need to make a Favorites Page, have it routed correctly when the Favorite button is hit.
