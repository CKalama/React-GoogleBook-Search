# React-GoogleBook-Search
This is a React Application utilizing the GoogleBooks API to search for Books within the Google Store. 

Deployed Heroku Link: https://warm-wildwood-53138.herokuapp.com/

Programming Tools => This React Application was built STRICTLY with React Native. Using an npx-create-react command line. The entire front-end is built with React. Using React logic such as Hooks (useEffect, useState), GoogleBooks API, and MongoDB. Combining these with JSX properties within each component. It was an excellent way of infusing API back-end knowledge with front-end React to learn more about Javascript, React.js, JSX, and Reducers. The Back-End is comprised of a simple server.js to create a Heroku Deployment connection. Along with a Mongoose connection to properly set up the 3rd party database to hold the data. 

Description => Built with only React, this application is a model of a simple Google Search but strictly for books and novels held within GoogleBooks paid store, allowing a very wide range of books to be displayed. Simply type a book into the search bar and click "search". You can also be directed back to the offical GoogleBooks Playstore to buy the book. Essentially, the app acts as a search engine that will redirect you to GoogleBooks Playstore.

Installation => No Installation is required, simply used the Deployed Heroku Link above.

Future Deployment (Coming Soon) => The ability to save books on the app locally, so that we can come back later and see what books we might have been looking at if we need to leave the application. This is the first thing that must be done to complete the entirety of the CRUD Model. From there, I would want to fully utilize the Google API and be allowed to search more than just books!
